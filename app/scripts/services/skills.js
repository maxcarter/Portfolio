Most of my experience working with high-level programming languages have been during academic courses. I have taken several engineering courses at the University of Waterloo that focus on such development: Fundamentals of Programming, Embedded Systems, Algorithms and Data Structures, Operating Systems, Embedded Microprocessor Systems, and Compilers. During the lab components of these courses I have built an Android application, kernel, compiler, implemented several algorithms, and programmed an FPGA Altera circuit board to become a physical audio player."

The games consisted of primarily basic animations supported by standard algorithmic techniques to create challenging and amusing games. See some of my projects below to play some of these high school flash based games. In addition to this experience, one of my university work terms was as a Software Developer on the Lesson Activity Builder team at SMART Technologies. During this employment I worked with modern web technologies to create interactive educational games for SMART Boards that emphasize learning while encouraging class participation. The games consisted of interactive touch and drag, physics simulation, and many fun animations supported by complex and robust code that remains adaptable to various theme customizations and updates. Game development is a very time consuming yet addicting industry and I hope to gain more experience in this area in the near future."

During one of my university co-op terms I redesigned an iOS application in Objective C that leveraged an entire game engine. The app redesign focused on a new sign-in workflow that decreases the length of time required for students to join an activity from their mobile devices. I also have experience working with Android development using Java. My Android experience is limited to a single lab component of an Embedded Systems course at the University of Waterloo. During this lab component we built an Android Pedometer that counts the users steps as they navigate through a given SVG map. The app used clever path finding algorithms to determine a path from the start point to the destination defined by the user as the user walks within the map."

The first, Digital Circuits, was an introduction to logic gates, latches, flip flops, and state machines. During the lab component of this course we built various small VHDL programs that implemented basic systems (such as an elevator and traffic lights). The next, more advanced, engineering course was Digital Hardware Systems and it focused heavily on VHDL and hardware design. During this course I learnt about combinational versus registered circuitry, synthesis, Delta-Cycle and RTL simulation, data flow, and VHDL best practices. During the lab component of this course we designed and built a Kirsch Edge Detector system in VHDL that can process any image and output all the edges, and direction of the edges, of the image."
